            You will have lots of free time throughout the week so while
            volunteering at Pacuare it is a good idea to bring books, music or
            movies that have been pre-downloaded. There are bike tours in the
            jungle available and volunteers will often play soccer and
            volleyball in their free time. There is also a bar located near the
            project site.

          <p className="m-0 text-13xl text-black">
            Like all of our sites the main focus of the Pacuare site is the
            conservation of sea turtles such as leatherbacks (Dermochelys
            coriacea), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), and hawksbill turtles
            (Eretmochelys imbricata). The Pacaure site also helps to treat
            injured sea turtles more than the Matapalo site. Volunteers will
            engage in community service by keeping the beach clean and
            maintaining community facilities. Pacuare is slightly more isolated
            than the Matapalo site and requires a boat to access it.

            The Pacuare house was built completely by locally sourced wood. The
            house has a rain water tank and solar panels in an effort to be as
            sustainable as possible. All of the rooms are mixed gender rooms.
            The rooms are also dorm style, with multiple bunk beds in each room.
            The site is slightly more rustic with showers located outside and
            limited access to electricity.
